### Personal Statement

I am a Product Manager with 6+ years experience working in fast paced agile software development environments, primarily on B2B products in the energy industry. Before working in software I spent time working on gas and power dispatching and scheduling desks facilitating energy trading and gas shipping activities on behalf of some of the largest oil and gas companies in the world. I pride myself on being a hands on, technically savvy Product Manager.
